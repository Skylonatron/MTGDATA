# MTGDATA
A place to collect and store community data about mtg formats to gain a deeper understanding about the game.
Everything in this repository is open to the public and free to use.

We will be using the honor rule for uploading true data, please don't ruin things for everyone by uploading fabricated data.

To upload decklists: Follow the directions on the youtube video -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eO9jzBYZHk
  or
Export deck in .csv format from MTGO. 
Add record information for both matches and games at the indicated locations in the sample file-> ("Sealed Deck Example")

Also please add a date at the indicated position as formats do tend to evolve over time. (Formatting is MM/DD/YYYY)
Make sure your data is in the right folder!!!

I have yet to figure out a naming scheme. Until then just give your data the same name as the folder it is in. (For example: M19Sealed)

Once I have enough data to work with, I will start making a script to compile the data into one large file to do analysis and train AI.
All the code I write to work with this data will be made publically available and free to use. I will also make videos explaining the results.

For this to be useful, we need as much data as we can possibly get. Please share this with people you know who play the game.
Together we can do something great :)

Thanks for contributing!
